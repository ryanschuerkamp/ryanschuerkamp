I love solving challenging problems. I am a sophomore at Miami University pursuing a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Data Science and Statistics. I am looking for internships and other opportunities in computer science, data science, and quantitative finance.

Seeing what problems I can solve and what I can build through code, the logic and planning that goes into a well-designed solution, and learning technologies to tackle new problems are just a few of the reasons I love coding and computer science. Whether it is working on web applications, writing scripts, or building systems, I enjoy the process of problem-solving.

Last semester, I took a master's research course on Network Analysis and Modeling. As a part of the course and CDC-funded research, I analyzed a causal map of what makes adolescents commit suicide. Last summer, I interned as a Software Engineer at Joot, a fintech startup. My experiences and coursework so far have helped me develop a solid foundation that I will continue to build off of in the coming years.

This coming semester, I will be conducting network science research focusing on modeling complex social systems. Also, I will work on implementing a blockchain-based forecast system. This summer, I will be interning at Artisan Partners as a Trading Intern. I am excited to learn more about quantitative finance and trading.

In addition to internships and other experiences, I am interested in learning from successful professionals both inside and outside the fields of computer science, data science, and quantitative finance.
