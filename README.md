### Hi there, I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹. 
I am a rising senior at Miami University pursuing a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science, a B.S. in Data Science and Statistics, and a minor in Mathematics. My research has focused on three main areas:
1. Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (an interpretable graph-based simulation model)
2. Network science and simulation for adolescent suicide prevention in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
3. Machine learning for healthcare.
   
As a result of these three research areas, I am interested in trustworthy machine learning (interpretable, robust, and fair) and its health applications. I plan on joining a Ph.D. program starting in the fall of 2024 to pursue these interests.

At Miami, I am advised by [Professor Philippe Giabbanelli](https://giabbanelli.com/). This summer, I am interning with [Professor Artur Dubrawski](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/artur-w-dubrawski/) in the [Auton Lab](https://autonlab.org/) at Carnegie Mellon University and am developing a machine learning-based approach for resuscitation sufficiency analysis.

Previously, I interned as a Quantitative Research Intern at Artisan Partners in Boston and as a Software Engineer at Joot, a fintech startup. I also worked on machine learning for cybersecurity with [Professor Suman Bhunia](https://sbhunia.me/).

Outside of work, I enjoy working out, cooking, hiking, and other hobbies, which you can read about on my [personal website](https://ryanschuerkamp.com/).

Please feel free to get in touch. My email is schuerr2 at miamioh dot edu.

P.S., most of my research code is elsewhere (e.g., [OSF](https://osf.io/n4cvg/) and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/7689513)).
