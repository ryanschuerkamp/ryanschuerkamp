I am a Sophomore majoring in Computer Science, Data Science and Statistics, and Mathematics. 

I'm currently teaching myself NumPy, Pandas, Machine Learning, and Quantitative Finance and am working on machine learning research with one of my computer science professors. 

I'm interested in learning more about the above topics and want to try and implement my own trading bot.
