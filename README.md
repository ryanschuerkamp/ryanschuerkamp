I love solving challenging problems. I am a rising Sophomore at Miami University majoring in Computer Science, Data Science and Statistics, and Mathematics. Currently, I am interning at [Joot](https://joot.io/) as a Software Engineer and researching applying machine learning to cybersecurity.

Seeing what problems I can solve and what I can build through code, the logic and planning that goes into a well-designed solution, and learning technologies to tackle new problems are just a few of the reasons I love coding and computer science. Whether it is working on web applications, writing scripts, or tuning machine learning algorithms, I enjoy the process of problem-solving.
