I love solving challenging problems. I am a Sophomore at Miami University majoring in Computer Science and Data Science/Statistics. 

Currently, I am taking a master's research course CSE 620 Network Analysis and Modeling. As a part of the course and CDC-funded research, I am analyzing a cognitive map of what makes children commit suicide. Last summer, I interned as a Software Engineer at Joot, a fintech startup. My experiences and coursework so far have helped me develop a solid foundation that I will continue to build off of in the coming years.
